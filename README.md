HoverButton for React

This README is currently incomplete, and holds placeholder information.

HoverButton is a simple reusable component for use in React. It allows many of the same uses as a normal HTML button, but has many of the modern effects and design aspects that modern web designers desire. With HoverButton, it’s a simple and quick process to implement a modern button with hover and click effects, and to also add any sort of custom function at any step of the process.

You can find the full documentation at: (doc page link)

INSTALLATION:
HoverButton requires React to run.

(npm command instructions)

You can also simply grab the HoverButton.js file from (insert github link) and insert the file into any React project. Simply use it as you would any other component.

USAGE:
After adding the file, make sure to import it. After adding the file, importing it, or simply using the NPM command, simply type: <HoverButton /> to use the default component. I will include a basic example below, but more detailed information about additional features and props can be found at: (documentation link.)

<HoverButton text={‘text on the button’} className={‘yourCSSclassname’} id={‘yourID’} onClick={yourFunction} />

Hoverbutton has it’s own built-in CSS class, but I recommend adding your own class to better fit your layout, and text you plan to display.
